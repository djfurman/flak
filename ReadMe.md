# FLAK

Federated List All-Knowing

## What it Does

Throughout the FACET-Acq community, there are needs to identify valid data from sources of which no FACET-Acq service is the system of record. While some of these may have web services available for validation in real time, others may publish only periodic files.

The FLAK application provides a single broker point to handle these data and ensure that appropriate caching takes place for APIs where they are supported, and lists are maintained with data updated as available.

## What kind of data

A non-exhaustive example list follows

 - North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes
 - National Stock Numbers (NSNs)
 - Approved Vendors
 - Approved Units of Issuance
 - Standardized Locations
